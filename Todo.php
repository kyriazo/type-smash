- Find out how to independently style every word. Copy 10 fast fingers.-



- Find out how to get a word set list. Possible file(csv) with delimited words inside.-


- Find out a way to record if the space key has been clicked on the computer.
 ??Create an appropriate handler?? The space key, when pressed, cancels the current word,
 either if it is typed correctly or not.


- Find a way to record the backspace key. Another approach is if the
  curent string coming from the typing area is smaller than before, do things.
  This also accounts for the use of the Delete button.

  Think about a way to make things a small proccess. Eg. When a word is to be typed
  there is a "proccess" that begins, its counters initialized etc. When the word is 'Spaced',
  then this "proccess" resets and restarts for the next word. Investigate if we need more handlers for this


  Investigate: Do I check each character separately or do i use a function that checks if the string is matched till the typed point
