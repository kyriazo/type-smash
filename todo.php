- Find out how to get a word set list. Possible file(csv) with delimited words inside.-

  Think about a way to make things a small proccess. Eg. When a word is to be typed
  there is a "proccess" that begins, its counters initialized etc. When the word is 'Spaced',
  then this "proccess" resets and restarts for the next word. Investigate if we need more handlers for this

  -When space is hit, if the current index doesnt match the current word length-1, thus the word is complete, count it as a hit.

-We have to find a way to highlight the word as it gets typed, do it not only on the hit of space but on the valid character too
